# Sales-Data-Analysis â€“ (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel)

## Project Overview: 
This project is a Sales Dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. It showcases key sales metrics and insights by importing, cleaning, and analyzing data from a CSV file. The dashboard provides interactive visuals to help stakeholders understand sales performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Project Objective: 
To design an interactive Excel dashboard that enables stakeholders to track and analyze monthly sales performance, including units sold, revenue, cost, and profit trends, across various products and countries. The dashboard supports data-driven decision-making by highlighting top-performing products, regional revenue contributions, and cost vs. revenue analysis through dynamic visualizations and slicers.

## Time Period Analyzed: 
The dataset covers the period from September 2019 to December 2020, capturing sales data across multiple countries and products during this 16-month span. This allows for analysis of both short-term trends and year-over-year comparisons.

## Tools Used: 
- Microsoft Excel
  - Power Query for data preprocessing
  - Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for analysis
  - Slicers and conditional formatting for interactivity
- CSV data source

## KPIs:
1.	Units Sold: Total number of product units sold across all countries and months, as per the Units Sold column.
2.	Profit: Total profit earned, calculated as the difference between Revenue and Cost for each transaction.
- **Profit** = `Revenue - Cost`  
3.	Profit(%): Indicates how efficiently the company converts cost into profit.
- **Profit Margin** = `(Profit / Cost) * 100`
4.	Revenue: Gross income from product sales, recorded under the Revenue column.
5.	Cost: Total cost associated with producing or acquiring the products, from the Cost column.

## Questions:
1.	"Among all the products, which one contributed the most to total revenue?"
2.	"Which country contributed the most to overall profit during the analysis period?"
3.	"Which product had the highest profit across all countries and months?"
4.	"During the period from September 2019 to December 2020, in which month did the profit show a significant increase?"
5.	"Which two products contributed the most to total profit in India?"
6.	"In which month did India generate the highest profit?"
7.	"Which two countries showed higher profit margins compared to others during the analysis period?"
